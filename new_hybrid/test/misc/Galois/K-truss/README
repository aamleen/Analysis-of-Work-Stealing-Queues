Program to find the maximal k-truss in a (randomly generated) undirected graph.
A k-truss is the largest sub-graph of a graph such that each edge is contained in at least k-2 triangles within this subgraph.

## To run Parallel:
```
$ make
$ ./ktruss_par -nbodies <problem_size> -k <k>
```

## To run Sequential:
```
$ make
$ ./ktruss_ser -nbodies <problem_size> -k <k>
```


### Default Values:
`nbodies` = 1000
`k` = 5
